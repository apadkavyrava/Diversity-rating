### How to run the project

Open the project in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

Run the notebooks in numerical order:

01_Dataset_prepating_and_overview.ipynb

02_Filling_Dataset.ipynb

03_Index_calculation.ipynb

After the last notebook finishes, the final results will be saved as final.xlsx in the root directory of the project.
