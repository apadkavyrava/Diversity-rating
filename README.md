Project Overview

The goal of this project was to create the Responsibility100 Index—a corporate sustainability index focused on Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI)—using company-provided equality reports. These reports include 26 metrics that capture different aspects of company EDI performance.

During the project, I prepared datasets, analyzed the data, safely imputed missing values, and designed and calculated the final Responsibility100 Index.
